* Deployment `config-hyperjs`:
  * [**`other`**] On macOS, revert to installing the configuration file into the home directory, because despite the announcement of the config move from the developers, the application seems to keep using the config file at the old location.
  * [**`improvement`**] Extend to support Linux and WSL.
* Deployment `config-vscode`:
  * [**`improvement`**] Decrement the editor font size from `15` to `14`.
